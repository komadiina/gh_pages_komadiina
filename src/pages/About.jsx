                        You really are interested in my autobiography, aren't you?
                    </p> <br />

                    <p>

                        There is quite a lot to say, so I hope you don't lose your nerves mindboggling this piece-of-whatever (<i>I've spent some time writing so best let it not go to waste thank youuu</i>).

                    <p>
                        Born in Gradiška and raised in Srbac, there were quite a few things that kept my interests living in the village. As the second-born son, life was a bit easier (<i>older siblings around the world please don't hate me for this</i>), but my father still pursued in raising both of his sons into respectable men. Goran was always more of a sporty and extroverted person, whereas I always tried figuring out what comforted me most - a mix with a little bit of everything kept me at bay the best.
                    </p> <br />

                    <p>
                        Most of my education (<i>primary and high school</i>) resided in Srbac - from "Jovan Jovanović - Zmaj", through Gymnasium in "Petar Kočić" and all the way up to Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka. Couldn't do everything in my hometown, I guess - had to visit the <i>"great city"</i>, like most of us students.
                        Primary school was a hit-and-miss, had good GPA but the experience was wonky at hand, but let's not delve that deep...
                    </p> <br />

                    <p>
                        During high school, I've explored many different areas of study, but they were mostly of technological aspect - music production and audio engineering, graphical design and illustration, amateur 3D design projects and such. However, my colleague Ivan was always <i>"the most technological guy"</i> in the class - and that wasn't for no reason. He always had passion for programming and technology in general, which motivated me to get into the programming world a bit more. This sadly, took an unexpected turn downwards. We organised a programming class which taught us basics in C++ from a renowned teacher, but due to a fairly small amount of uninterested people, the lecturer couldn't see any way to organise the class without breaking our bank. So things ended there. Aside from that, I was the unluckiest person in my class related to injuries - I missed so many events just because my cockiness exceeded it's limits. Ended up tearing my ligaments from a sprain ankle, a serious mononucleosis, many immune system retardations, the list could go on forever...
                    </p> <br />

                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, I've still kept my interests in the areas aforementioned. Music production was still a thing, I was that one kid who produced music and was kind of edgy (<i>but hey, we all grow up</i>) in that part. Locally people mostly contacted either me or Ivan (<i>sometimes we even collaborated</i>) in the sense graphic designs for local/remote occurring events. Music was up on sale on my <a href="https://www.beatstars.com/yungogg" class="italic text-slate-500">BeatStars</a> and was distributed for promotion on my Instagram and <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/prodbyogg" class="italic text-slate-500">SoundCloud</a>.
                        Audio engineering was my passion - since my father Zoran worked as a radio technician and a sound engineer for a local radio station, and also my brother Goran was a DJ and an audiophile aswell - things piled up on me without breaking a sweat. There I was, surrounded by the soundwaves of their constant equipment testing. I ended up liking it - trust me, once you try even entry-level audio equipment, there is no going back (<i>even people hard of hearing say so</i>).

                        In 2020, when COVID was active, I've graduated high school. Deciding to go for the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade and preparing the entrance exam, financial objectifications occurred which caused me to redirect myself for the same university but in Banja Luka. As far as I can deduce, none of the decisions would be a wrong one. Getting accepted onto the budget financing in the Banja Luka's faculty, my career of software engineering started. First year was hell. The culture, the work ethic, the standards - everything was nothing like I would've thought it was (<i>one of the main reasons I repeated that same year :D</i>). Upon finishing the first year, the second went buttery smooth and so did the winter semester of the third. I've met some great people along the way and most of them are great friends up to this day. Another notable achievement is that I've been a part of <b>EESTEC Banja Luka</b>, being a participant in events such as <i>Soft Skills Academy 2021 (SSA21)</i>,

                    <p>
                        At uni, I've learned about many things - starting from basic algebra, calculus, linear algebra, discrete and applied maths, statistical analysis, through the theory of electrotechnics (<i>magnetism, electricity, general and computer electronics</i>), through basic programming concepts in <code>C</code> and <code>C++</code>, then came <code>Java</code> (<i>which was practically hell on Earth</i>) where we got introduced with concepts such as parallel processing, thread operations, data streams, SOLID principles, classful hierarchy organization and deeper object-oriented principles. Also worth mentioning was that we got familiar with computer architecture concepts such as kernel operations and it's structures, caching operations and methods, (virtual) address space layout and principles, bootloader design and, the most infamous of it all, <b>x86 assembly programming</b> in <code>NASM</code>. In the <i>Formal methods in Software Engineering</i> class we learned about automata (<i>both non-deterministic and deterministic</i>), Turing machines, machine learning concepts and algorithms, neural network design (<b>from scratch</b> in <code>Python</code>, mind you). Backpropagation algorithm proof and derivation was one of the worst moments which I will remember for the rest of my life. Was a pretty good, laidback course nonetheless. In the <i>Computer Architecture</i> course we learned about <code>CUDA</code> and algorithm performance optimization implementing it's technology. <i>Cryptography and Computer Security</i> course granted us knowledge around the security aspects of many system designs, structures of many known school algorithms such as RC4, DES, 3DES, RSA, aswell as the web-oriented security aspect in authorization, authentication and identification of system's users.
                        Aside from strictly-technological parts, we had our interests in both <i>system</i> and <i>software engineering</i> theory, assisting our <b>UML</b>-based assignments using tools such as <i>StarUML</i>, solving many diagram-based problems.

                        When it comes to my hobbies, they revolve around stressful creative tasks, such as cooking, getting lost in the woods or accidentally locking myself in garages. My passed grandfather Aco was always enthusiastic when it came to cooking - a hunter's goulash was his expertise. Since he lived relatively far away, whenever he came over, was it during summer or during winter, some activity had to be involved - how can you, as a child, not be excited then? Aside from cooking, he was a recreational hunter and a fisherman. Exploring such activities proves to a man that theres more to life other than the virtual element. I've always shared a passion with interactive games, such as chess, but that also had toned down a bit. Nowadays, I mostly enjoy spending my time equally, both learning new technological advancements and craftsmanships (<i>recently, I've started dabbling in woodworking with my father</i>). Then comes hiking, nature-adventure and so on. Video games have always been a part of my life, so that couldn't go down without any achievments - participated in many <i>Counter-Strike</i> tournaments, always being a pick-up (<i>Faceit lv. 10 bragging rights, mind you</i>).
